  "description": "Codemotion Madrid IV edition will be held in **November 27- 28** in \t[Universidad CEU San Pablo, Campus de Montepr√≠ncipe](http://www.uspceu.com/es/facultades-escuelas/escuela-politecnica-superior/index.php). Send us your talk or workshop and be a part of the biggest IT event in Spain!\n\nTalks must be 40 minutes and workshops 1 hour and 45 minutes in length. Please use the field `Comments` if you have any specific requirement for your presentation.\n\n**This C4P closes on July 5** and we will take about one month to create the agenda, with the collaboration of our experts and communities. We will also launch a survey to ask the people what they prefer to see in the next Codemotion and the results will help us to make a better selection. We won't use your personal information for other purposes.\n\n**Codemotion Madrid won't pay for any talk, but will give the speakers coming from abroad a partial refund for the travel expenses**.\n\nPlease e-mail us at [info@codemotion.es](mailto:info@codemotion.es) for any doubt.
